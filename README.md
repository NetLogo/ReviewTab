# NetLogo plugin: Review tab

Adds a fourth tab, "Review", for recording and replaying model runs.

Requires the `abmplus` branch of NetLogo 5.0.x.  Does not work with stock NetLogo distribution.

## Development status

See https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Model-runs for current info on this work.
Development on the code in this plugin has been abandoned but we're building something very similar
on the `modelruns` branch in the main NetLogo repo, for planned inclusion in NetLogo 5.1.

## Building

If you build the abmplus branch, the contents of this repository will be downloaded and built for you.

## Using

After building, restart NetLogo and the new tab should appear.
