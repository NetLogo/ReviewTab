# NetLogo plugin: Review tab

Adds a fourth tab, "Review", for recording and replaying model runs.

Requires NetLogo 5.0beta4 (coming soon).

## Using

Drop ReviewTab.jar into your 5.0beta4 plugins directory and restart NetLogo.

## About the source code

BehaviorSpace is written in the Scala programming language. Scala code
compiles to Java byte code and is fully interoperable with Java and
other JVM languages.

Make sure you are using Scala 2.9.0.1.

The Makefile expects to find the unzipped Scala distribution
directory at /usr/local/scala-2.9.0.1.  If you have it in another
location, edit the Makefile to point the location you are using.

## Building

Use the NETLOGO environment variable to tell the Makefile which NetLogo.jar to compile against.  For example:

    NETLOGO=/Applications/NetLogo\\\ 5.0 make

If compilation succeeds, `ReviewTab.jar` will be created.
